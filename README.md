# GameMuseum 
`Game Museum` is the name of the project we developed as part of the Visual Computing course at the University of Aveiro in `Unreal Engine 5`.  

It is a virtual museum with two rooms, each dedicated to a game that, in some way, proved to be impactful in the history of video games: `Fortnite` and `Pokémon GO`.  

In each room, the player will have to solve a challenge that will be presented to reveal the reason why the game was impactful.  

The game files can be found in the `GameMuseum` folder. 

Builds of the project for both `DirectX 11` and `DirectX 12` are available in the `Releases` section. Additionally, in this section, you will also find the `video report` in European Portuguese explaining the technical aspects of our work

Additionally, the goals we aimed to achieve with this project, as well as other details and features, are outlined in the `Presentation.pptx` file.  


### Project's Goals

- Apply the theoretical concepts learned in class to our project.  
- Learn to use a completely new engine.  
- Deepen our understanding of key concepts relevant to the context of our game:  

  - **Lighting**: Realistic lighting simulates the interaction of light with surfaces and materials, essential for an immersive experience. Our project implements global illumination, dynamic shadows, and reflections to enhance scene realism.  
  - **Animations and Interactivity**: Iconic characters in our museum are animated dynamically to avoid static models, enhancing realism and meeting the interactivity requirement of the project.  
  - **World Building**: Detailed terrain, realistic textures, and dynamically animated elements (e.g., leaves in the wind) set the visual and emotional tone for each room in the museum.  
  - **Post-Processing**: Visual effects like fog in the Fortnite room polish the aesthetic and establish the atmosphere, adding depth and mystery to the scene.
